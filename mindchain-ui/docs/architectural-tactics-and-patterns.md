# MindChain: Architectural Tactics and Patterns

## 1. Architectural Tactics

Architectural tactics are design decisions that influence the achievement of a quality attribute response. The following tactics have been selected to address MindChain's key non-functional requirements:

### 1.1 Performance Tactics: Reduce Latency

**Non-functional Requirement Addressed:** NFR1.1, NFR1.3 (Response time and real-time messaging latency)

**Tactic Description:**
To ensure responsive user interactions and real-time messaging, we employ several latency reduction tactics:

- **Caching:** Implement multi-level caching (browser, CDN, API, database) to reduce repeated data fetching
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Use non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture for handling requests
- **Data Locality:** Store frequently accessed data together to minimize retrieval time
- **Lazy Loading:** Load data and components only when needed to improve initial page load times
- **Connection Pooling:** Maintain database connection pools to reduce connection establishment overhead

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data like user profiles and active queries
- Implement client-side caching with service workers for offline capabilities
- Use CDN for static assets with appropriate cache headers
- Employ database read replicas for query-heavy operations
- Implement WebSocket connection pooling for chat functionality

### 1.2 Availability Tactics: Fault Detection and Recovery

**Non-functional Requirement Addressed:** NFR3.1, NFR3.2, NFR3.3 (System uptime and fault tolerance)

**Tactic Description:**
To achieve the required 99.9% uptime and ensure system reliability, we implement:

- **Health Monitoring:** Continuously monitor system components to detect failures
- **Redundancy:** Deploy redundant instances of critical components
- **Stateless Design:** Design services to be stateless where possible to facilitate recovery
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Prevent cascading failures by failing fast when dependencies are unavailable
- **Automated Recovery:** Implement self-healing mechanisms for common failure scenarios

**Implementation Approach:**
- Deploy services across multiple availability zones
- Implement health check endpoints for all microservices
- Use container orchestration (Kubernetes) for automated restarts and scaling
- Implement circuit breakers using libraries like Hystrix or Resilience4j
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana
- Use message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka) to handle temporary service unavailability

### 1.3 Scalability Tactics: Resource Pooling and Distribution

**Non-functional Requirement Addressed:** NFR2.1, NFR2.2, NFR2.3 (Horizontal scaling and concurrent user support)

**Tactic Description:**
To support the required number of users and chat sessions, we implement:

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Design services to scale out rather than up
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests across multiple service instances
- **Database Sharding:** Partition data to distribute database load
- **Stateless Services:** Design services to be stateless to facilitate scaling
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Use message queues for non-time-critical operations

**Implementation Approach:**
- Deploy services in containers with auto-scaling capabilities
- Use load balancers (e.g., NGINX, AWS ELB) for distributing traffic
- Implement database sharding by user ID or institution
- Use Redis for distributed session management
- Implement message queues for handling peak loads
- Design efficient database indexes based on access patterns

### 1.4 Security Tactics: Authentication and Authorization

**Non-functional Requirement Addressed:** NFR4.1, NFR4.2, NFR4.3, NFR4.5 (Security and access control)

**Tactic Description:**
To ensure system security and protect user data, we implement:

- **Layered Security:** Implement security at multiple levels (network, application, data)
- **Least Privilege:** Grant minimal necessary permissions to users and components
- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest
- **Token-based Authentication:** Use JWT tokens for secure authentication

**Implementation Approach:**
- Implement OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect for authentication
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Store passwords using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
- Use prepared statements for database queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement CSRF tokens and SameSite cookie attributes
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### 1.5 Modifiability Tactics: Component Isolation

**Non-functional Requirement Addressed:** NFR6.1, NFR6.3 (Maintainability and feature rollout)

**Tactic Description:**
To facilitate system maintenance and evolution, we implement:

- **Modular Design:** Organize the system into cohesive, loosely coupled components
- **Information Hiding:** Encapsulate implementation details within components
- **Interface Abstraction:** Define clear interfaces between components
- **Configuration Externalization:** Separate configuration from code
- **Feature Toggles:** Implement mechanisms to enable/disable features without code changes

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use domain-driven design principles to define bounded contexts
- Implement clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Define stable API contracts between services
- Use dependency injection for component composition
- Implement feature flags using a service like LaunchDarkly or a custom solution
- Maintain comprehensive API documentation

## 2. Implementation Patterns

The following design patterns will be used in the MindChain architecture:

### 2.1 Microservices Pattern

**Description:**
The system is decomposed into small, independently deployable services organized around business capabilities. Each service has its own database and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs.

**Role in Architecture:**
- Enables independent development and deployment of system components
- Allows different services to scale independently based on demand
- Facilitates technology diversity where appropriate
- Improves fault isolation and system resilience

**Implementation:**
The MindChain system will be divided into the following microservices:
- User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management
- Query Service: Manages query submission, status tracking, and lifecycle
- Matching Service: Implements the expert matching algorithm
- Chat Service: Manages real-time communication
- Notification Service: Handles system notifications
- Analytics Service: Collects and processes system metrics

### 2.2 API Gateway Pattern

**Description:**
A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices, aggregating the results, and returning them to the requester.

**Role in Architecture:**
- Provides a single entry point for all client requests
- Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and rate limiting
- Simplifies client interactions by hiding the complexity of the microservices
- Enables API composition for client-specific requirements

**Implementation:**
- Use an API Gateway solution (e.g., Kong, AWS API Gateway, or custom implementation)
- Implement authentication and authorization at the gateway level
- Configure rate limiting and request throttling
- Set up request routing based on URL patterns
- Implement response caching where appropriate

### 2.3 Event-Driven Architecture Pattern

**Description:**
A software architecture pattern promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. Components communicate through events rather than direct method calls.

**Role in Architecture:**
- Enables loose coupling between components
- Facilitates asynchronous processing
- Improves scalability by distributing event processing
- Supports complex event processing and reactive systems

**Implementation:**
- Use a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for event distribution
- Implement the publish-subscribe pattern for event notifications
- Define clear event schemas for interoperability
- Use event sourcing for maintaining audit trails where appropriate
- Implement event handlers for different types of system events

### 2.4 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern

**Description:**
A pattern that separates read and write operations to different models. Commands (writes) and queries (reads) use separate interfaces and often separate data stores.

**Role in Architecture:**
- Optimizes read and write operations independently
- Improves scalability by allowing separate scaling of read and write workloads
- Enables specialized data models for different use cases
- Facilitates eventual consistency in distributed systems

**Implementation:**
- Separate command and query models for complex domains
- Use specialized read models optimized for specific query patterns
- Implement eventual consistency between write and read models
- Use event sourcing to maintain the source of truth for the write model
- Implement materialized views for efficient querying

### 2.5 Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Description:**
A design pattern used to detect failures and prevent cascading failures in distributed systems by "breaking the circuit" to failing services.

**Role in Architecture:**
- Prevents system overload when a service is failing
- Enables graceful degradation of functionality
- Allows failed services to recover without being overwhelmed
- Provides fast failure responses instead of waiting for timeouts

**Implementation:**
- Use a circuit breaker library (e.g., Hystrix, Resilience4j)
- Configure appropriate thresholds for tripping the circuit
- Implement fallback mechanisms for when the circuit is open
- Set up monitoring for circuit breaker states
- Configure automatic recovery testing (half-open state)

### 2.6 Repository Pattern

**Description:**
A pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory collection of domain objects.

**Role in Architecture:**
- Provides a clean separation between domain logic and data access
- Centralizes data access logic and reduces duplication
- Facilitates unit testing through abstraction
- Enables switching between different data sources or ORMs

**Implementation:**
- Define repository interfaces in the domain layer
- Implement concrete repositories in the infrastructure layer
- Use dependency injection to provide repository implementations
- Implement unit of work pattern for transaction management
- Use specification pattern for complex queries

### 2.7 Observer Pattern (for Notifications)

**Description:**
A behavioral design pattern where an object (subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them of state changes.

**Role in Architecture:**
- Enables loose coupling between event sources and handlers
- Facilitates the implementation of the notification system
- Supports the event-driven architecture
- Allows for dynamic registration of notification handlers

**Implementation:**
- Implement observer interfaces for different notification types
- Use the publish-subscribe pattern for scalable notification delivery
- Support filtering and routing of notifications based on user preferences
- Implement notification persistence for offline users
- Support multiple notification channels (in-app, email, push)
