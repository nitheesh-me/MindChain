## 2. Major Design Decisions (Architecture Decision Records)

### 2.1 ADR 1: Adoption of Microservices Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
MindChain needs to support multiple distinct functionalities (user management, query processing, expert matching, real-time communication) that have different scaling requirements and development velocities. We need an architecture that allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of these components.

**Decision:**
Adopt a microservices architecture where each major subsystem is implemented as a separate service with its own database and API.

**Consequences:**

- **Positive:**

  - Independent scaling of components based on demand
  - Technology flexibility for different services
  - Isolated failure domains
  - Parallel development by different teams
  - Easier to understand and maintain individual services

- **Negative:**
  - Increased operational complexity
  - Distributed system challenges (consistency, transaction management)
  - Need for service discovery and API gateway
  - More complex testing and deployment pipelines
  - Potential performance overhead from network communication

**Implementation Notes:**

- Each microservice will have a well-defined API and responsibility
- Services will communicate via REST APIs for synchronous operations and message queues for asynchronous operations
- An API gateway will provide a unified interface for client applications
- Service discovery will be implemented using a service registry

### 2.2 ADR 2: Real-time Communication Using WebSockets

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
MindChain requires real-time chat functionality between users and experts. Traditional request-response patterns are not suitable for this type of interaction, as they would require frequent polling or long-polling approaches that are inefficient.

**Decision:**
Implement real-time communication using WebSocket protocol, with Socket.IO as the implementation library.

**Consequences:**

- **Positive:**

  - True real-time bidirectional communication
  - Reduced latency compared to HTTP polling
  - Lower overhead for frequent messages
  - Built-in support for reconnection and fallback mechanisms
  - Ability to broadcast messages to multiple clients

- **Negative:**
  - Stateful connections require more server resources
  - More complex server infrastructure to handle WebSocket connections
  - Need for load balancing with session affinity
  - Additional complexity for handling disconnections and reconnections
  - Potential firewall issues in some network environments

**Implementation Notes:**

- Implement a dedicated WebSocket service for handling real-time communications
- Use Redis as a pub/sub mechanism for scaling WebSocket servers horizontally
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections
- Provide fallback mechanisms for environments where WebSockets are blocked

### 2.3 ADR 3: Expert Matching Algorithm Based on Vector Embeddings

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
A core feature of MindChain is matching queries to the most appropriate experts. This requires understanding the semantic content of queries and expert profiles beyond simple keyword matching.

**Decision:**
Implement the expert matching algorithm using vector embeddings of text content, with similarity scoring based on cosine similarity of these embeddings.

**Consequences:**

- **Positive:**

  - Better semantic understanding of queries and expertise
  - Ability to match related concepts even when exact keywords don&apos;t match
  - Improved matching quality over time as the model learns
  - Flexibility to incorporate different types of information into the matching process
  - Can leverage pre-trained language models for better initial performance

- **Negative:**
  - Computational overhead for generating and comparing embeddings
  - Need for training data and model maintenance
  - Potential for bias in the matching algorithm
  - More complex to explain match results to users
  - Requires specialized ML infrastructure and expertise

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, Sentence-BERT) for generating embeddings
- Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient similarity search
- Implement a hybrid approach that combines vector similarity with other factors (availability, response rate, etc.)
- Include feedback mechanisms to improve the matching algorithm over time
- Provide transparency about match criteria to users

### 2.4 ADR 4: Progressive Web App (PWA) for Cross-Platform Support

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
MindChain needs to be accessible across various devices and platforms, including desktop and mobile. Developing native applications for each platform would be resource-intensive and complicate maintenance.

**Decision:**
Implement MindChain as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Next.js framework with React.

**Consequences:**

- **Positive:**

  - Single codebase for all platforms
  - Progressive enhancement for better user experience
  - Offline capabilities and local caching
  - Reduced development and maintenance effort
  - Automatic updates without app store approval process
  - SEO benefits from server-side rendering

- **Negative:**
  - Limited access to some native device features
  - Performance may not match native apps for complex interactions
  - Browser compatibility considerations
  - Storage limitations compared to native apps
  - Push notification limitations on iOS

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation
- Implement service workers for offline functionality and caching
- Use responsive design principles for adapting to different screen sizes
- Implement app manifest for installability
- Use web push notifications where supported
- Provide graceful degradation for browsers with limited feature support
