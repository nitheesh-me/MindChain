## 3. Architecturally Significant Requirements

The following requirements are considered architecturally significant as they have substantial impact on the system's structure, performance characteristics, and overall design:

### 3.1 Real-time Communication (FR4.1, NFR1.3)

**Rationale:** The need for real-time chat functionality influences the entire communication infrastructure. It requires websocket connections, state management, and efficient data synchronization mechanisms. This impacts the choice of backend technologies, database design, and client-server communication patterns.

### 3.2 Expert Matching Algorithm (FR3.1, FR3.2, NFR1.4)

**Rationale:** The intelligent matching of queries to experts is a core feature that differentiates MindChain. This requires sophisticated algorithms, potentially involving machine learning components, and access to institutional data. The matching system needs to be both accurate and performant, influencing data modeling and service architecture.

### 3.3 Incremental Notification System (FR5.3, NFR5.2)

**Rationale:** The requirement for non-disruptive, incremental notifications affects how the system manages user attention and delivers time-sensitive information. This impacts the event handling architecture, notification delivery mechanisms, and user interface design.

### 3.4 Scalability Requirements (NFR2.1, NFR2.2, NFR2.3)

**Rationale:** Supporting thousands of users and concurrent chat sessions requires a scalable architecture. This influences decisions about stateless services, database sharding, caching strategies, and deployment infrastructure.

### 3.5 Security and Privacy (NFR4.1 - NFR4.5)

**Rationale:** Handling sensitive academic and personal information requires robust security measures throughout the system. This affects authentication mechanisms, data storage, API design, and communication protocols.
