abstract = {A profile describes a set of properties, e.g. a set of skills a person may have, a set of skills required for a particular job, or a set of abilities a football player may have with respect to a particular team strategy. Profile matching aims to determine how well a given profile fits to a requested profile and vice versa. The approach taken in this article is grounded in a matching theory that uses filters in lattices to represent profiles, and matching values in the interval [0,1]: the higher the matching value the better is the fit. Such lattices can be derived from knowledge bases to represent the knowledge about profiles. An interesting question is, how human expertise concerning the matching can be exploited to obtain most accurate matchings. It will be shown that if a set of filters together with matching values by some human expert is given, then under some mild plausibility assumptions a matching measure can be determined such that the computed matching values preserve the relevant rankings given by the expert. A second question concerns the efficient querying of databases of profile instances. For matching queries that result in a ranked list of profile instances matching a given one it will be shown how corresponding top-k queries can be evaluated on grounds of pre-computed matching values. In addition, it will be shown how the matching queries can be exploited for gap queries that determine how profile instances need to be extended in order to improve in the rankings.}

abstract = {The recent rapid growth of the Internet content has led to building recommendation systems that guide users to their needs through an information retrieving process. An expert recommendation system is an emerging area that attempts to detect the most knowledgeable people in some specific topics. This detection is based on both the extracted information from peoples’ activities and the content of the documents concerned with them. Moreover, an expert recommendation system takes a user topic or query and then provides a list of people sorted by the degree of their relevant expertise with the given topic or query. These systems can be modeled by information retrieval approaches, along with search engines or a combination of natural language processing systems. The following study provides a critical overview of existing expert recommendation systems and their advantages and disadvantages, considering as well different techniques employed by them.}

abstract = {Question answering websites are becoming an ever more popular knowledge sharing platform. On such websites, people may ask any type of question and then wait for someone else to answer the question. However, in this manner, askers may not obtain correct answers from appropriate experts. Recently, various approaches have been proposed to automatically find experts in question answering websites. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach to effectively find experts for the category of the target question in question answering websites. Our approach considers user subject relevance, user reputation and authority of a category in finding experts. A user’s subject relevance denotes the relevance of a user’s domain knowledge to the target question. A user’s reputation is derived from the user’s historical question-answering records, while user authority is derived from link analysis. Moreover, our proposed approach has been extended to develop a question dependent approach that considers the relevance of historical questions to the target question in deriving user domain knowledge, reputation and authority. We used a dataset obtained from Yahoo! Answer Taiwan to evaluate our approach. Our experiment results show that our proposed methods outperform other conventional methods.}
