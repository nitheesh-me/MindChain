==== Behavioral Patterns
Patterns that define how objects interact and communicate with each other.

1. *Observer Pattern*
/ Focus: Event Notification

MindChain uses the Observer pattern to implement the notification system, allowing objects to subscribe to events and receive updates.

*Implementation Details*
- Event publishers for system state changes
- Multiple subscriber types for different notification channels
- Filtering mechanisms for notification relevance
- Batching strategies for notification delivery

*Benefits*
- Loose coupling between event sources and consumers
- Support for multiple notification channels
- Dynamic subscription management
- Scalable notification delivery

2. *Strategy Pattern*

/ Focus: Algorithm Selection
MindChain uses the Strategy pattern to implement the expert matching algorithm, allowing different matching strategies to be selected based on context.

_Implementation Details_
- Common interface for all matching strategies
- Specialized strategies for different query types
- Context-aware strategy selection
- Composite strategies for complex matching scenarios

_Benefits_
- Flexibility to change matching algorithms at runtime
- Encapsulation of algorithm-specific logic
- Simplified testing of individual strategies
- Easy addition of new matching algorithms
