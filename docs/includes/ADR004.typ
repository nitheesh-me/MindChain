==== ADR 004: Data Storage Strategy\*
```
Status: Accepted

Context
-------
MindChain needs to store and manage various types of data, including user profiles, queries, chat messages, notifications, and analytics. Different data types have different access patterns, consistency requirements, and scaling needs. The data storage strategy must support the microservices architecture while ensuring data integrity, performance, and scalability.

We need to decide on the data storage technologies and patterns for MindChain, considering factors such as data model complexity, query patterns, consistency requirements, and scaling needs.

Decision
--------
We will adopt a polyglot persistence approach, using different database technologies for different services based on their specific data requirements. Specifically:

-  User Management Service: PostgreSQL for structured user profile data with complex relationships and strong consistency requirements.
- Query Management Service: PostgreSQL for structured query data with transaction support and complex querying needs.
- Expert Matching Service: Elasticsearch for efficient vector similarity searches and full-text query capabilities.
- Communication Service: MongoDB for flexible schema chat messages with high write throughput and document-oriented structure.
- Notification Service: Redis for high-performance, in-memory notification storage with time-to-live support.
- Analytics Service: ClickHouse for columnar storage optimized for analytical queries and time-series data.
- Integration Service: Redis for caching and temporary storage of integration data.

Each service will own its database, with no direct database access from other services. Cross-service data access will be handled through service APIs or event-driven communication.

Consequences
------------
Positive:
- Optimized data storage for different access patterns and requirements
- Independent scaling of databases based on service needs
- Improved performance through specialized database technologies
- Enhanced resilience with isolated database failures
- Flexibility to evolve data models independently for each service
Negative:
- Increased operational complexity in managing multiple database technologies
- Challenges in maintaining data consistency across different databases
- Need for specialized knowledge across different database systems
- More complex backup, monitoring, and disaster recovery processes
- Potential for data duplication across services

Alternatives Considered
-----------------------
Single Relational Database:
  Using a single PostgreSQL database for all services would simplify operations and ensure strong consistency but would create tight coupling between services and limit scalability. This approach was rejected due to its conflict with microservices principles and scaling limitations.

Single NoSQL Database:
  Using a single MongoDB or similar NoSQL database for all services would provide schema flexibility but would not be optimized for all access patterns and would still create coupling. This approach was rejected as it wouldn't provide the specialized capabilities needed for different data types.

Database-per-Service with Same Technology:
  Using the same database technology (e.g., PostgreSQL) for all services but with separate instances would reduce operational complexity but wouldn't optimize for different data requirements. This approach was considered but rejected in favor of more specialized optimization.

Shared Database with Schema-per-Service:
  Using a single database instance with separate schemas for each service would reduce infrastructure costs but would create potential coupling and scaling issues. This approach was rejected as it wouldn't provide true isolation between services.
