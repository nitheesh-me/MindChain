==== ADR 001: Microservices Architecture for MindChain\*
```
Status: Accepted

Context
-------
MindChain requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that can support multiple distinct functionalities (user management, query matching, real-time communication, etc.) while allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of different components. The system needs to handle varying loads across different features and must be able to evolve over time as new requirements emerge.

We need to decide on the overall architectural style for the MindChain platform, considering factors such as scalability, maintainability, development efficiency, and deployment flexibility.

Decision
--------
We will adopt a microservices architecture for the MindChain platform, with the following key characteristics:

- The system will be decomposed into seven core microservices aligned with the identified subsystems: User Management, Query Management, Expert Matching, Communication, Notification, Analytics, and Integration.
- Each microservice will have its own database, following the database-per-service pattern to ensure loose coupling.
- Services will communicate primarily through asynchronous messaging using a message broker (RabbitMQ) for event-driven interactions.
- RESTful APIs will be used for synchronous service-to-service communication when necessary.
- An API Gateway will be implemented to provide a unified entry point for client applications.
- Services will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.

Consequences
------------
Positive:
- Independent scalability of services based on demand (e.g., the Communication service can scale during peak usage times)
- Technology flexibility allowing different services to use the most appropriate tech stack
- Enhanced fault isolation preventing failures in one service from cascading to others
- Parallel development enabling multiple teams to work on different services simultaneously
- Easier maintenance and updates with the ability to deploy changes to individual services
Negative:
- Increased operational complexity in deployment, monitoring, and management
- Potential performance overhead due to network communication between services
- Challenges in maintaining data consistency across service boundaries
- More complex testing and debugging processes
- Higher initial development cost compared to a monolithic approach

Alternatives Considered
-----------------------
Monolithic Architecture:
  A single, unified codebase containing all functionality would be simpler to develop initially and would avoid the complexity of service communication. However, it was rejected due to concerns about scalability, long-term maintainability, and the ability to evolve different parts of the system independently.

Modular Monolith:
  A compromise approach with a single deployment unit but clear internal module boundaries was considered. While this would reduce operational complexity, it would still limit independent scaling and technology choices, which are important for the diverse requirements of MindChain's subsystems.

Serverless Architecture:
  A fully serverless approach using functions-as-a-service was evaluated for its scaling benefits and reduced operational overhead. However, it was deemed less suitable for the stateful, long-running processes required by the real-time communication and matching features of MindChain.
