==== ADR 006: Expansion to Multi-Tenant Architecture
```
Status: In Review

Context
-------
MindChain was initially designed to serve a single organization (IIIT Hyderabad). However, there is growing interest from other institutions and organizations to adopt the platform. To support this expansion, the system must evolve into a multi-tenant architecture that can serve multiple organizations while maintaining data isolation, scalability, and customizability.

The multi-tenant architecture must address the following requirements:
- Data isolation to ensure that each organization's data is securely separated.
- Scalability to handle varying loads from multiple tenants.
- Customizability to allow tenants to configure certain features according to their needs.
- Efficient resource utilization to minimize operational costs.

Decision
--------
We propose transitioning MindChain to a **multi-tenant architecture** with the following key characteristics:

- **Tenant Isolation**: Each tenant's data will be logically separated using a database-per-tenant approach or schema-per-tenant approach, depending on the service's requirements.
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Core services (e.g., API Gateway, Authentication) will be shared across tenants to optimize resource usage.
- **Tenant Configuration**: A configuration service will be implemented to allow tenants to customize features, branding, and access control settings.
- **Tenant Identification**: All requests will include a tenant identifier (e.g., subdomain, header, or token) to route and process requests appropriately.
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes will be used to dynamically scale services based on tenant-specific loads.
- **Monitoring and Billing**: A centralized monitoring and billing system will track resource usage and generate tenant-specific reports.

Consequences
------------
Positive:
- Enables MindChain to expand to multiple organizations, increasing its reach and impact.
- Ensures data isolation and security for each tenant.
- Provides flexibility for tenants to customize the platform to their needs.
- Optimizes resource utilization by sharing infrastructure where possible.
- Supports scalability to handle varying loads across tenants.

Negative:
- Increased complexity in managing tenant-specific configurations and data isolation.
- Higher operational overhead for monitoring, billing, and scaling multiple tenants.
- Potential performance impact if shared infrastructure is not properly scaled.
- Requires significant development effort to refactor existing services for multi-tenancy.

Alternatives Considered
-----------------------
1. **Single-Tenant Instances**:  
   Deploying separate instances of MindChain for each organization would ensure complete isolation but would result in high operational costs and inefficiencies. This approach was rejected due to scalability concerns.

2. **Hybrid Multi-Tenancy**:  
   Combining shared infrastructure for some services (e.g., Authentication) with isolated instances for others (e.g., Query Management) was considered. While this approach offers flexibility, it adds complexity and was deemed less efficient than a fully multi-tenant architecture.

3. **Federated Architecture**:  
   Allowing each organization to host its own instance of MindChain while federating certain services (e.g., Analytics) was considered. This approach was rejected due to the operational burden on tenant organizations and the lack of centralized control.
