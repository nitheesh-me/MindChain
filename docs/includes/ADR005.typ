==== ADR 005: Use of Blockchain for Data Integrity
```
Status: Rejected

Context
-------
MindChain handles sensitive data, including user profiles, queries, and analytics. Ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications are critical requirements. Blockchain technology was considered as a potential solution due to its immutability and distributed ledger capabilities.

The proposal involved using a private blockchain to store critical data, such as query logs, audit trails, and analytics, to ensure tamper-proof records and enhance trust in the system.

Decision
--------
We decided **not** to adopt blockchain technology for data integrity in MindChain for the following reasons:

- The complexity and overhead of maintaining a private blockchain are not justified for the current use case.
- Blockchain's immutability conflicts with the need for data updates and deletions (e.g., GDPR compliance for user data).
- The performance overhead of blockchain transactions would negatively impact system responsiveness.
- Existing database technologies (e.g., PostgreSQL with audit logging) can meet the data integrity requirements more efficiently.

Consequences
------------
Positive:
- Avoids the operational complexity and resource overhead of blockchain.
- Simplifies compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR.
- Reduces development and infrastructure costs.

Negative:
- Missed opportunity to leverage blockchain's tamper-proof capabilities.
- Potential perception of weaker data integrity compared to blockchain-based solutions.

Alternatives Considered
-----------------------
1. **Audit Logging in Relational Databases**:  
   Using PostgreSQL's built-in audit logging features to track changes to critical data. This approach was chosen as it provides sufficient data integrity with minimal overhead.

2. **Hash-Based Integrity Checks**:  
   Storing cryptographic hashes of critical data in a separate database to detect unauthorized modifications. This approach was considered but deemed unnecessary given the adequacy of audit logging.

3. **Third-Party Integrity Services**:  
   Using external services to verify data integrity. This approach was rejected due to concerns about vendor lock-in and additional costs.

4. **Blockchain**:  
   A private blockchain for storing critical data was rejected due to the reasons outlined above.
