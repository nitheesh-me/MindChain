==== Structural Patterns
Patterns that define how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

1. *Repository Pattern*
/ Focus: Data Access
MindChain uses the Repository pattern to abstract the data layer and provide a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

*Implementation Details*
- Generic repository interfaces for common operations
- Specialized repositories for complex domain objects
- Separation of query and command repositories
- Unit of work pattern for transaction management

*Benefits*
- Decoupling of business logic from data access details
- Simplified testing through repository mocking
- Consistent data access patterns across the application
- Ability to switch underlying data stores with minimal impact

2. *Adapter Pattern*

/ Focus: Integration
MindChain uses the Adapter pattern to integrate with external systems and services while maintaining a consistent internal interface.

_Implementation Details_
- External system adapters for institutional data sources
- API adapters for third-party services
- Legacy system integration adapters
- Protocol adapters for different communication methods

_Benefits_
- Isolation of external system dependencies
- Simplified testing through adapter mocking
- Ability to swap external systems with minimal impact
- Consistent error handling for external interactions
