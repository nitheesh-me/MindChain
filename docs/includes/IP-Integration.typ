==== Integration Patterns
Patterns that define how different systems and services communicate and share data.

1. *API Gateway Pattern*
/ Focus: Client Communication

MindChain uses the API Gateway pattern to provide a unified entry point for client applications, handling cross-cutting concerns and routing.

*Implementation Details*
- Centralized authentication and authorization
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Response aggregation from multiple services
- Rate limiting and traffic management

*Benefits*
- Simplified client integration
- Consistent security enforcement
- Reduced client-server communication
- Improved monitoring and analytics

2. *Circuit Breaker Pattern*

/ Focus:Fault Tolerance
MindChain uses the Circuit Breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures and improve system resilience when communicating with external services.

_Implementation Details_
- Failure threshold monitoring for external calls
- Automatic circuit opening on failure threshold breach
- Half-open state for testing recovery
- Fallback mechanisms for degraded functionality

_Benefits_
- Prevention of cascading failures
- Reduced latency from failing services
- Automatic recovery testing
- Graceful degradation under failure conditions
