==== Performance Tactics

Tactics employed to optimize response time, throughput, and resource utilization.

1. *Caching Strategy*
/ Focus: Response Time Optimization

MindChain implements a multi-level caching strategy to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

*Implementation Details*
- In-memory caching for user profiles and expertise data
- Redis-based distributed caching for query matching results
- Browser-side caching for static assets and UI components
- Time-based cache invalidation strategies to maintain data freshness

*Quality Attribute Addressed*
This tactic directly addresses *EFR1 (Response Time)* by ensuring that frequently accessed data is available without expensive database queries or computations, reducing average response time by up to *70%* for cached operations.


2. *Asynchronous Processing*

/ Focus: Resource Management
MindChain employs asynchronous processing for computationally intensive operations to prevent blocking and improve overall system responsiveness.

_Implementation Details_
- Message queues for expert matching operations
- Background processing for notification batching and delivery
- Scheduled tasks for analytics and data aggregation
- Event-driven architecture for decoupling time-intensive operations

_Quality Attribute Addressed_
This tactic addresses both *EFR1 (Response Time)* and *EFR2 (Scalability)* by ensuring that resource-intensive operations don't block the main request-response cycle, allowing the system to remain responsive even under heavy computational load.
