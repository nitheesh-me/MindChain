==== Scalability Tactics

Tactics employed to handle growing workloads and user base efficiently.

1. *Horizontal Scaling*
/ Focus: Capacity Management

MindChain is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of services rather than increasing the capacity of existing instances.

*Implementation Details*
- Stateless microservices that can be replicated across multiple instances
- Load balancing to distribute requests across service instances
- Auto-scaling based on CPU utilization and request volume
- Containerization for consistent deployment across environments

*Quality Attribute Addressed*
This tactic addresses *EFR2 (Scalability)* by allowing the system to handle increased load by adding more resources in a linear fashion, without requiring architectural changes.

2. *Data Partitioning*

/ Focus: Database Scalability
MindChain implements data partitioning strategies to distribute database load and improve query performance at scale.

_Implementation Details_
- Horizontal sharding of user data based on department or faculty
- Time-based partitioning for historical query and chat data
- Read replicas for analytics and reporting workloads
- Polyglot persistence with specialized databases for different data types

_Quality Attribute Addressed_
This tactic addresses *EFR2 (Scalability)* and *EFR1 (Response Time)* by ensuring that database operations remain efficient even as data volumes grow, preventing database bottlenecks.
