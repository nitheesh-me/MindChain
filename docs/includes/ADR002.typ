==== ADR 002: Real-time Communication Implementation\*
```
Status: Accepted

Context
-------
MindChain requires robust real-time communication capabilities for its chat interface and notification system. The platform needs to support persistent conversations between users and experts, real-time status updates, and immediate delivery of notifications. The solution must be scalable to handle thousands of concurrent users while maintaining low latency.

We need to decide on the technology and approach for implementing real-time communication features in MindChain, considering factors such as performance, reliability, scalability, and developer experience.

Decision
--------
We will implement real-time communication using WebSockets as the primary protocol, with Socket.IO as the implementation library, supported by a Redis-based message broker for scaling. Specifically:

- Socket.IO will be used on both client and server sides to provide WebSocket communication with automatic fallback to HTTP long-polling when WebSockets are not available.
- A Redis pub/sub system will be implemented to enable horizontal scaling of the WebSocket servers.
- Messages will be persisted in a MongoDB database for message history and offline delivery.
- The system will implement room-based communication for chat sessions and user-specific channels for notifications.
- A presence system will track online/offline status and typing indicators.
- Message delivery acknowledgments and read receipts will be implemented to ensure reliability.

Consequences
------------
Positive:
- Low-latency, bidirectional communication enabling true real-time interactions
- Reliable message delivery with acknowledgment mechanisms
- Scalable architecture that can handle thousands of concurrent connections
- Graceful degradation to HTTP long-polling when WebSockets are not supported
- Comprehensive feature set including presence detection and typing indicators
Negative:
- Increased server resource usage compared to request-response patterns
- Additional complexity in deployment and scaling WebSocket servers
- Potential challenges with load balancers and proxies that aren't configured for WebSockets
- Need for careful connection management to prevent resource leaks
- Increased complexity in handling offline/reconnection scenarios

Alternatives Considered
-----------------------
HTTP Polling:
  Regular HTTP requests to check for updates would be simpler to implement but would create unnecessary server load and wouldn't provide true real-time capabilities. This approach was rejected due to performance concerns and poor user experience.

Server-Sent Events (SSE):
  SSE would provide real-time updates from server to client but lacks the bidirectional communication needed for chat features. It was considered for notifications only but rejected in favor of a unified approach for all real-time features.

GraphQL Subscriptions:
  Using GraphQL subscriptions would integrate well with a GraphQL API but would add complexity if the rest of the API uses REST. This approach was considered but deemed less mature and potentially more complex than Socket.IO for our specific requirements.

MQTT:
  A lightweight publish-subscribe protocol designed for IoT would be efficient but would require additional client-side libraries and might be less suitable for web applications. It was rejected as being optimized for different use cases than ours.
