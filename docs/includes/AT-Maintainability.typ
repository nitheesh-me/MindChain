==== Maintainability Tactics
Tactics employed to facilitate system evolution, updates, and long-term maintenance.

1. *Service Isolation*
/ Focus: Modularity
MindChain isolates functionality into independent services that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.

*Implementation Details*
- Clear service boundaries with well-defined interfaces
- Domain-driven design principles for service organization
- Independent deployment pipelines for each service
- Versioned APIs to manage service evolution

*Quality Attribute Addressed*
This tactic addresses *EFR9 (Extensibility)* and *EFR10 (Testability)* by allowing individual services to evolve independently, reducing the risk and complexity of system changes.

2. *Comprehensive Monitoring*

/ Focus: Observability
MindChain implements extensive monitoring and observability features to facilitate troubleshooting and maintenance.

_Implementation Details_
- Distributed tracing across service boundaries
- Centralized logging with context-aware correlation
- Real-time metrics and dashboards for system health
- Automated alerting for anomaly detection

_Quality Attribute Addressed_
This tactic addresses *EFR3 (Availability)* and *EFR10 (Testability)* by providing visibility into system behavior, enabling rapid identification and resolution of issues.
