==== Architectural Patterns
High-level patterns that define the overall structure of the MindChain system.

1. *Microservices Architecture*
/ Focus: System Structure
MindChain is built using a microservices architecture, decomposing the application into small, independently deployable services organized around business capabilities.

*Implementation Details*
- Six core microservices aligned with subsystems
- API Gateway for client communication
- Service discovery for dynamic service location
- Independent data stores for each service

*Benefits*
- Independent development and deployment cycles
- Technology flexibility for different services
- Improved fault isolation
- Targeted scaling of high-demand services

2. *Event-Driven Architecture*

/ Focus: Communication Pattern
MindChain uses an event-driven architecture for asynchronous communication between services, enabling loose coupling and improved responsiveness.

_Implementation Details_
- Event bus for publishing and subscribing to events
- Event sourcing for critical state changes
- Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for complex domains
- Idempotent event handlers for reliability

_Benefits_
- Decoupled services that can evolve independently
- Improved system resilience through asynchronous processing
- Better scalability for event producers and consumers
- Enhanced auditability through event history
