==== ADR 003: Expert Matching Algorithm Approach\*
```
Status: Accepted

Context
-------
The core value proposition of MindChain is its ability to match queries to the most relevant experts based on expertise, research interests, and availability. The matching algorithm needs to be accurate, efficient, and adaptable to different types of queries and expertise domains. It must also consider factors such as expert workload, availability, and past performance.

We need to decide on the approach and technology for implementing the expert matching algorithm, considering factors such as accuracy, performance, explainability, and adaptability.

Decision
--------
We will implement a hybrid matching algorithm that combines vector embeddings for semantic matching with a rule-based scoring system for contextual factors. Specifically:

- Query and expertise descriptions will be converted to vector embeddings using a pre-trained language model (BERT or similar) to capture semantic meaning.
- Cosine similarity between query vectors and expert expertise vectors will form the base matching score.
- Additional rule-based factors will be applied to adjust the base score, including:
  - Expert availability and current workload
  - Historical response rate and quality
  - Specific keyword matching for technical terms
  - Departmental and course affiliations
- The system will use a weighted scoring model that can be tuned based on feedback and performance data.
- Match explanations will be generated to show why a particular expert was matched to a query.
- The algorithm will be implemented as a separate microservice with its own scaling capabilities.

Consequences
------------
Positive:
- High-quality semantic matching that understands the meaning behind queries
- Flexibility to incorporate multiple factors beyond text similarity
- Explainable results that can show why a match was made
- Ability to improve over time through feedback and performance data
- Scalable architecture that can handle complex matching operations
Negative:
- Higher computational requirements for generating and comparing vector embeddings
- Complexity in tuning the weights for different factors
- Need for significant training data to optimize the algorithm
- Potential cold-start issues for new experts with limited history
- Challenges in maintaining the balance between semantic and rule-based factors

Alternatives Considered
-----------------------
Keyword-Based Matching:
  A simpler approach using keyword extraction and matching would be less computationally intensive but would miss semantic relationships and synonyms. This approach was rejected due to its limited understanding of natural language queries.

Pure Machine Learning Model:
  A fully ML-based approach using a trained classifier could potentially provide high accuracy but would require extensive training data and would be less explainable. This approach was rejected due to the initial lack of training data and the need for explainability.

Graph-Based Matching:
  Using a knowledge graph to represent expertise and queries would capture complex relationships but would be more complex to implement and maintain. This approach was considered promising for future iterations but too complex for the initial implementation.

Manual Assignment:
  Having department coordinators manually assign queries would ensure human judgment but wouldn't scale and would introduce delays. This approach was rejected as it wouldn't fulfill the real-time matching requirement.
